# Trend Choice

🛒 TrendChoice – Full-Stack E-Commerce Application

TrendChoice is a production-ready full-stack e-commerce web application built with React and Node.js.

The project demonstrates real-world frontend–backend integration(Cart, checkout, orders, and tracking logic), REST APIs, state management, and deployment best practices.

This project was built to showcase my full-stack development skills and industry-standard architecture.
